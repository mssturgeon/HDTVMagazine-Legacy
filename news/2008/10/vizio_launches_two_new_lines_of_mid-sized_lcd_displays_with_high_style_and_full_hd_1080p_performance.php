<br /></p>

<p><br />
<B>IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 21 /PRNewswire/</B> -- VIZIO, America's HDTV Company, has announced today four new high performance Full HD 1080p LCD flat panel displays in 32" and 37" sizes. The VOJ370F and VOJ320F are the first of the exclusive decor-colored "Java" product line with colored bezel and stand treatments that integrate elegantly into contemporary styling of today's homes. VIZIO has also released two additional Full HD models based on the popular VIZIO "VO" series of products. The VO32LF-32" LCD and VO37LF-37" LCD are now Full HD 1080p, offered at very competitive prices.</p>

<p>In conjunction with VIZIO's recent introduction of their flagship XVT Series of high performance plasma and LCD products, today's announcement of these exclusive decor color and FHD models demonstrates VIZIO's commitment to bring cutting edge styles, features and performance to more consumers faster than any other brand.</p>

<p>"By bringing Full HD 1080p resolution to smaller screen sizes, but at considerably lower price points than competitors, VIZIO is making affordable 1080p Flat Panel TVs available to consumers with space limitations," stated Paul Gagnon of DisplaySearch/NPD. "In addition, VIZIO is keying on a growing trend among design-conscious consumers with the Java series, emphasizing style and design along with performance and function."</p>

<p>"With aggressive marketing and buzz created by the LCD industry, Full HD or 1080p has become a 'must have' feature for all new introductions," stated Riddhi Patel, iSuppli's Principal Analyst for Television Systems. "iSuppli expects the Full HD penetration to reach 29% for North America LCD TVs in 2008, growing at a compounded rate of 36% between now and 2012."</p>

<p>Priced to compete in today's challenging economy, the decor-color "Java" VOJ370F 37" LCD and VOJ320F 32" LCD sets provide PIP/POP viewing, 1920 x 1080 native resolution with an impressive 6500:1 contrast ratio with DCR, fast 6.5ms refresh rates, a wide 178-degree viewing angle and high 500 nits brightness.</p>

<p>VIZIO's updated VO series 37" VO37LF and 32" VO32LF LCD sets provide Full HD 1920 x 1080 native resolution with an impressive 6500:1 contrast ratio with DCR, fast 6.5ms refresh rates, a wide 178-degree viewing angle and high 500 nits brightness.</p>

<p>All four new models provide three HDMI v1.3 inputs, two on the rear panel and a third on the HD Game port located on the side of the set. The HD Game Port offers quick connections for external devices with HDMI outputs such as new game consoles and HD camcorders. Additional analog video inputs are provided on the rear and side panels including component video, VGA, composite and S-Video. Each model includes a standard/HDTV/QAM combination tuner. Enhanced video performance can be easily tuned with reduced pixel noise, improved contrast and advanced color balancing and equalization from VIZIO's intuitive on-screen menu. Offering the ultimate in convenience, these models have a detachable base to accommodate on-wall mounting and built-in speakers with 12 watts per channel. SRS Lab's TruSurround XT(TM) audio process was incorporated as well to create a high quality surround sound experience when watching DVD movies and programs broadcast in surround sound, all with just the VIZIO's two speakers. It creates a 3D wall of sound that moves past the physical width of the TV so the listener no longer needs to sit directly in the middle of the couch to hear the best audio effect. TruSurround XT also lifts dialog out of the chaos of sound and provides deep bass.</p>

<p>"In today's economy, it is even more important for VIZIO to continue to offer Americans the newest features with unique new styles at extraordinary values," said Laynie Newsome, vice president of sales and marketing at VIZIO. "Capturing the pulse of the consumer to meet their demand for the best-looking and highest performance value in flat panel TVs is our focus."</p>

<p>VIZIO guarantees that these TVs have no bright pixels or permanent burn-in and backs them with one-year free in-home service and repair along with lifetime tech support. Pricing and availability are as follows:<br />
